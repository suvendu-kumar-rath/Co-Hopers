- Centralized API services

### 4. **Developer Experience**
- Clear import paths
- Better code organization
- Consistent naming conventions

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### **API Layer**
- Configured Axios client with interceptors
- Organized API calls by domain (KYC, Payment, Office)
- Error handling and request/response transformation

### **Constants Management**
- Centralized route definitions
- Payment configuration constants
- Office data organization
- Navigation structure management

### **Utility Functions**
- File validation and handling utilities
- Social sharing functionality
- Form validation utilities
- Reusable helper functions

### **Component Architecture**
